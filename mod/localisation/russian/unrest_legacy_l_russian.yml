 unrest.155.name:0 "$unrest_title$ Slaves Rally on [revolt_planet.GetName]"
 unrest.155.desc:0 "Clandestine slave meetings at night, raised levels of defiance towards superiors and missing goods can mean only one thing. The slaves on [revolt_planet.GetName] are radicalizing, spreading dissent and discord among their peers - and fear to the rest of the population. Whatever they are up to, it can't be good. "
 unrest.155.a:0 "This calls for action."
 unrest.160.name:0 "$unrest_title$ Slave Revolt on [revolt_planet.Planet.GetName]"
 unrest.160.desc:1 "The slave population on [revolt_planet.Planet.GetName] has united and risen in open, armed revolt against the local leadership. The situation has escalated quickly, as rebel forces have struck against and disabled several key targets simultaneously. The fate of the planet now depends on our defending troops. If they fail, we lose [revolt_planet.Planet.GetName]."

 unrest.167.desc:0 "The unthinkable has happened. Our forces on [revolt_planet.Planet.GetName] have been defeated and our last loyal subjects executed mercilessly by the slave rebels, who have now declared independence. It is a dark day in the history of [From.GetSpeciesName]kind."
 unrest.167.a:0 "We will return in full force to take what is ours."
 unrest.167.b:0 "Maybe it's for the best..."

 unrest.168.desc:0 "Greetings [Root.GetSpeciesName]. We are freedom fighters - former slaves - from the [old_owner.GetName], where we suffered much abuse under the oppression of [old_owner.GetRulerTitle] [old_owner.GetRulerName]. We have long admired your egalitarian standards, the "[Root.GetSpeciesAdj]" way, as we would refer to it back home, and we share your values. We have seceded and wish to be a part of your nation, if you will have us?"
 unrest.168.a:0 "Join us. Here we are all equal."
 unrest.168.a.tooltip:0 "[old_owner.GetName] will be notified that we have accepted their former slaves."

 unrest.169.b:0 "We will step on all your rights."
 unrest.169.c:0 "Congratulations. Now they're your problem."
